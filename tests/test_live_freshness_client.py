"""The dashboard's client-side freshness check, tested by running it.

`pollLiveDataFreshness` decides whether to tell a reader that the data in front
of them has been withheld. It used to decide that from `data_age_seconds`
alone:

    Number(freshness.data_age_seconds || 0) <= LIVE_DATA_STALE_SECONDS

which reads an absent age as an age of zero. Four of the gate's five blocked
outcomes carry no usable age -- a missing timestamp, an unparseable one, one in
the future, and a stale source fallback -- so in every case except ordinary
staleness the reader sat on a page that looked live. That is the outcome the
branch exists to prevent, and it was the only one it did not prevent.

These tests execute the real function out of `app.js` under node rather than
asserting on its source text, because a string check passes whatever the
function actually does. The extraction is checked separately, in pure Python,
so renaming or deleting the function fails the suite even where node is absent.
