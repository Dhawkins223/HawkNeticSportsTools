"""One command that answers "is this environment actually fit to run".

The readiness checklist in `docs/deployment-readiness-checklist.md` asks for
things nobody can confirm from a code review: that migrations are applied *here*,
that the research-only controls hold *here*, that somebody can actually log in
*here*. Each of those is already computable, and each lives somewhere different —
`database_startup_status` behind `/readyz`, `production_safety_status` behind the
dashboard, the auth posture spread across environment flags and a user table. So
the answer existed but nobody could get it in one look, and the checklist items
stayed unticked because ticking them meant running four things and knowing how to
read each.

The failure this is aimed at is specific and has already happened twice. Migration
`0013` sat merged-but-unapplied while every worker crash-looped on
`postgres_database_not_ready`, and `0014` very likely repeated it, because nothing
in production applies migrations and nothing asks whether they were applied. A
pending migration is invisible until a collector dies of it.

Design decisions worth keeping:

- **Read-only, always.** This reports; it never applies a migration, creates an
  account, or writes a flag. An operator has to be able to run it against
  production without thinking about it.
- **A check that cannot run is not a check that passed.** Anything unresolvable
  reports `unknown` and fails the run, because "we could not tell" and "it is
  fine" are the two states this file exists to keep apart.
- **Every failure carries its remedy.** A gate that says only "no" sends the
  reader back to the docs; the point is to skip that trip.
