"""Statistical power and multiple-testing control.

This module exists to answer one question before any research result is
believed: *could this study have detected the effect it claims to have found,
and would it still look significant after accounting for every other hypothesis
the project tested?*

Two failure modes are being defended against, and both are ordinary rather than
exotic:

**Underpowered claims.** Detecting a small edge takes far more resolved
predictions than a season provides. The arithmetic is unforgiving: required
sample scales with the inverse square of the effect, so halving the edge you
hope to detect quadruples the evidence you need. A strategy evaluated on three
hundred bets cannot distinguish a 2% edge from zero, and reporting its win rate
as though it could is the most common error in applied betting research.

**Multiple testing.** A backlog of fifty experiments run at a 5% threshold
produces around two or three "discoveries" when nothing is real. Confidence
intervals do not protect against this — every one of those false positives will
have an interval excluding zero, which is exactly what makes them convincing.
Benjamini-Hochberg control is applied across the family of tests, not to each
test in isolation.

No dependency on scipy: the normal quantile function is implemented directly
in ``math.normal`` (Acklam's rational approximation, refined with a Halley
step against the stdlib error function), accurate to roughly machine
precision across the range these tests use.
