"""Does anything this platform knows improve on the closing price?

Section O of `docs/sports-prediction-research-program.md` settled the first
question: a walk-forward Elo rating beats a home base rate and loses decisively
to the de-vigged closing line. That result rules out the model this platform
would otherwise have shipped, and it leaves exactly one question worth asking
next -- backlog E-24.

The right form of that question is not "model or market". It is: start from the
market's own probability, and ask whether adding what the model knows moves it
anywhere useful. In log-odds space that is a two-term regression,

    logit(p) = a + b * logit(market) + c * (logit(elo) - logit(market))

where `b` measures whether the market price should be trusted as posted (b = 1)
or shaded toward a coin flip (b < 1), and `c` is the only place a claim of edge
can live. If `c` is indistinguishable from zero, the rating adds nothing the
price did not already contain, and that is the answer.

Two disciplines make the answer usable rather than flattering:

1. **The fit is walk-forward too.** Coefficients for a season are estimated only
   from seasons that had already finished. A single regression fit over the whole
   history would report an in-sample improvement that no bettor could have had.

2. **The baseline is the market, not a coin flip.** The comparison that decides
   this is the blend against the closing price on identical games, paired, with
   an interval. Beating the base rate again would prove nothing.

Nothing here promotes a model. The output is a research verdict, and the two
coefficients are reported so the shape of the answer is visible rather than
summarized into a single number.
