"""Age out raw payload bodies without losing the evidence they prove.

`raw.source_payloads` keeps one full response body per collection cycle. Kalshi
ingestion runs every five minutes, so the table grows without bound: it filled
the staging volume outright and production is on the same curve.

Deleting those rows is not an option. Core observations carry foreign keys into
them, and the project's integrity contract treats a payload's content hash as
authoritative evidence that a collection happened and what it contained. So this
prunes the *body* and keeps everything that proves the collection: the row, its
batch lineage, its timestamps, its parser version, and its `content_hash`.

The body is replaced by a tombstone recording when it was pruned and how large it
was. Dedup and import lineage compare the `content_hash` column and never re-hash
the body, so pruning does not disturb either. The body itself is not recoverable.
