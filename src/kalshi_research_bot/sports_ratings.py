"""Team ratings built from the games this platform has already settled.

`math/elo.py` has always been able to turn two ratings into a probability, but
nothing produced ratings: `ModelBot` reads them out of a `Game.signals` dict that
only the sample-JSON demo ever fills. The consequence is that every sports number
the platform publishes is a bookmaker price wearing different units. The board
says so honestly -- `baseline_only`, `track_only` -- but a baseline is not a
model, and without one there is nothing to compare a market price against.

This module closes that gap using data already in PostgreSQL. Settled rows in
`app.sports_prediction_logs` carry `final_score_json`, so the platform's own
collection history reconstructs the game results an Elo rating needs.

Three properties matter more than the rating arithmetic:

1. **No leakage.** Games are processed in start-time order and every prediction
   is made from ratings that contain only games that had already finished. A
   game never contributes to its own forecast. This is backlog E-05 enforced by
   construction rather than audited afterwards.

2. **The market is a baseline, not an opponent to ignore.** Elo is graded against
   the home base rate *and* against the de-vigged closing price, because beating
   a coin flip is not evidence and a model that loses to the closing line has
   found nothing. This is backlog E-21 and E-24.

3. **A verdict, including a negative one.** The comparison reports a paired
   confidence interval and how many games the effect would need. An interval
   containing zero is reported as inconclusive and can be recorded in the
   research registry as such. Nothing here promotes a model: promotion stays
   behind `MODEL_PROMOTION_ENABLED`, and the report states `track_only`.

Ratings are `Decimal` end to end, matching the repository rule that exact
probability values keep their scale until a serialization boundary.
