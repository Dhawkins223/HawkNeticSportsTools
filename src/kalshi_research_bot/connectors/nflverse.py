"""Historical NFL games with their closing lines, from a public archive.

The sample-size arithmetic in `docs/sports-prediction-research-program.md`
section J is the constraint that decides whether this research program can
answer anything. Live collection accumulates a few hundred graded games a year;
the paired tests the backlog specifies need thousands. Waiting for the collector
to reach that is a multi-year plan.

nflverse publishes every NFL game since 1999 -- final scores, closing moneylines,
spreads and totals, rest days, roof, surface, temperature, wind, and officials --
as a plain CSV in a public GitHub repository. That is roughly 7,300 completed
games, over 5,200 of them carrying both closing moneylines, available now and at
no cost.

Two boundaries keep this honest:

1. **It is not collected evidence.** These rows are a third party's historical
   record, not something this platform observed with a timestamp and a payload
   hash of its own. They never enter `app.sports_prediction_logs`, so they cannot
   reach the board, the freshness gates, or any live metric. They are loaded for
   research and identified by the content hash of the file they came from.

2. **A closing line from an archive is a reported close, not a verified one.**
   Backlog E-03 asks whether a stored close is genuinely the last pre-start
   price. For this archive that question is unanswered: the file carries no quote
   timestamps. Results graded against it inherit that limitation, which is why
   the dataset version records the file hash -- so a later answer can be applied
   to exactly the rows it was computed from.

anything published from it.
